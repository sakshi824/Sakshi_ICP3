Create a class Employee and then do the following
• Create a data member to count the number of Employees
• Create a constructor to initialize name, family, salary, department
• Create a function to average salary
• Create a Fulltime Employee class and it should inherit the properties of Employee class
• Create the instances of Fulltime Employee class and Employee class and call their member functions.

SOLUTION:
-->We have created the generic class with name, family, salary and department
-->And created a data member inorder to counting the number of employees(count_of_employees)
-->And then defined the constructor with name, family, salary and department to intiliaze the variables
-->And then declared the function in order to calculate the average salary of an employee
-->and then defined the function inorder to show the details of an employee
-->And then declared the fulltime employee class inorder to inherit the class properties bu using the super method inorder to intiliaze them.
-->Then declared the main function inorder to call the functions by giving the values to the variables.
Here is the output of the code:

The count of an employee is             : 4
Average salary of an employee is: 148750.0


2.Using NumPy create random vector of size 20 having only float in the range 1-20.
Then reshape the array to 4 by 5
Then replace the max in each row by 0 (axis=1)

SOLUTION:
-->In this numpy python program we have imported the numpy package inorder to get the random variables.
-->used an function in order to replace the maximum value of an array based on the conditions of the axis x and y
-->Then defined the main function inorder to create a random vector of size 
   EX:To sample Unif[a, b): (b - a) * random_sample() + a
-->And then reshaping the array to 4 by 5 by using the reshape().
-->Moreover, replacing the maximum value in each row by zero.

Here is the output of the code:
